I used the following encryption methods:
1. Swapping adjacent characters, first one swaps with second one, third with forth and so on. For example a b c i o e u z x y becomes b a i c e o z u y x
2. Swapping adjacent characters, first one swaps with second one, third with forth and so on. For example a b c i o e u z x y becomes b a i c e o z u y x
And finally got this encrypted result:
i p y x
Can you help me decipher the original message?
","Let's decipher it step by step:
After the decrypting the 2. step, we get:
p i x y
After the decrypting the 1. step, we get:
i p y x
So the original message was:
i p y x

"I have a secret message.
I used the following encryption methods:
1. Caesar cipher or shift cipher with a distance of -9, shifting every letter to the one -9 after it cyclically. For example a b c i o e u z x y becomes n o p v b r h m k l
2. Swapping first half of the message with the second half. For example a b c i o e u z x y becomes e u z x y a b c i o
