"I have a secret message.
I used the following encryption methods:
1. Caesar cipher or shift cipher with a distance of 13, shifting every letter to the one 13 after it in the ABC cyclically. For example a b c i o t g e u z x y becomes n o p v b g t r h m k l
2. Permutation cipher in which charceters (0, 1, 2) move to positions (0, 2, 1) respectively. For example a b c i o t g e u z x y becomes a c b i t o g u e z y x
And finally got this encrypted result:
n d l w h e l i c p e z
