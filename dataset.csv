3. Shift and increment cipher with a base of 2, shifting every letter to the one (2 + position) after it in the ABC cyclically. For example a b c i o t g e u z x y becomes c e g n u a o n e k j l
4. Shift and increment cipher with a base of 4, shifting every letter to the one (4 + position) after it in the ABC cyclically. For example a b c i o t g e u z x y becomes e g i p w c q p g m l n
And finally got this encrypted result:
h e c i t j
Can you help me decipher the original message?
","Let's decipher it step by step:
After the decrypting the 4. step, we get:
d z w b l a
After the decrypting the 3. step, we get:
b w s w f t
After the decrypting the 2. step, we get:
a u p s a n
After the decrypting the 1. step, we get:
n a s p u a
So the original message was:
n a s p u a

"I have a secret message.
I used the following encryption methods:
1. Caesar cipher or shift cipher with a distance of 15, shifting every letter to the one 15 after it in the ABC cyclically. For example a b c i o t g e u z x y becomes p q r x d i v t j o m n
2. Swapping adjacent characters, first one swaps with second one, third with forth and so on. For example a b c i o t g e u z x y becomes b a i c t o e g z u y x
3. Shift and increment cipher with a base of 6, shifting every letter to the one (6 + position) after it in the ABC cyclically. For example a b c i o t g e u z x y becomes g i k r y e s r i o n p
4. Inverse order, reading the message from end to start. For example a b c i o t g e u z x y becomes y x z u e g t o i c b a
